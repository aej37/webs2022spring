    <h2 id='daily'> Daily Reading (via horoscope.com)</h2>
    <p id='dailytxt'>Today you might experience, however briefly, the most intense and refined type of spiritual love,
      Virgo. Perhaps this is for a friend, child, lover, or maybe for all life forms on the planet.
      You're also feeling especially artistic, so if you've been planning to make something as a gift,
      this is the time to do it. All signs bode well for other artistic projects as well. Go to it, and enjoy your day. </p>
    </div>

    <div class = 'column'>

    <h2 id='love'> Love Reading (via horoscope.com) </h2>
    <p id='lovetxt'>The day's celestial lineup means you can go somewhere really cool, and meet someone fun in the
      process. Or you might take a philosophical approach and try yoga or meditation classes, or perhaps enjoy
      learning about a new philosophy. Either way, you won't be disappointed, and will probably end up meeting someone who will be able to keep you laughing for some time to come.
     </p>
   </div>

   <div class = 'column'>
    <h2 id='career'> Career Reading (via horoscope.com)</h2>
      <p id='careertxt'>Your general mood improves a great deal today, and this will make it much easier for you to
        deal with the immature attitude of the people around you. Naturally, you will be more patient, thereby opening
        the door to better relations all around.</p>

          <h2>The Devil Card</h2>
          <p id='tarottxt'>The Devil card represents your shadow (or darker) side and the negative forces that constrain you and hold you back from being the best version of yourself.
            You have found yourself trapped between the short-term pleasure you receive and the longer-term pain you
            experience.To break free of these negative patterns, you need to acknowledge the hold they have over you.
            Shine your light on the negative patterns that have been standing in your way and they will slowly leave you.
