    <h2 id='daily'> Daily Reading (via horoscope.com)</h2>
    <p id='dailytxt'>You may start the day feeling a little insecure about everything going on around you, Pisces.
       The increased pressures of work might have strained your nerves a little.
       However, a lot of love and attention from friends, children, and the special person in your life should
      have you feeling better about everything in no time. In the evening, relax and watch a video with your mate! </p>

    <h2 id='love'> Love Reading (via horoscope.com) </h2>
    <p id='lovetxt'>You are willing to take some risks today as far as love is concerned,
      and are open to a little passionate adventure. The day's celestial configuration brings the devil out in you,
      and you are prepared to say yes to a promising relationship that you may have held back from for fear of being
      hurt. Others may be astounded at your boldness, but for once you don't care.</p>

    <h2 id='career'> Career Reading (via horoscope.com)</h2>
      <p id='careertxt'>Rely on your intuition. The voice inside your head knows exactly how to proceed,
        so trust this inner voice. People may try to cloud your head with facts that are untrue or not validated.
        Don't get thrown off track by them. Listen to yourself.</p>
