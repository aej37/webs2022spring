    <p id='lovetxt'>You normally enjoy a feeling of closeness and familiarity with friends and partners,
       but today you may feel like getting away from everyone and having some time and space to yourself.
      This could actually be very important, as it will recharge your batteries
       and give you a chance to transform your outlook and attitude on a few things. Go for it.

          <h2>The Hanged Man Card</h2>
          <p id='tarottxt'>The Hanged Man reminds you that sometimes you have to put everything on hold before you can take the next step,
             or the Universe will do it on your behalf (and it may not always be at the most convenient time!) The Hanged Man calls you to release the old mental models that no longer serve you so you can see your world from a new perspective
            and embrace new opportunities.
