    <h2 id='daily'> Daily Reading (via horoscope.com)</h2>
    <p id='dailytxt'>Work may seem more like a drag than usual, as today your thoughts are at home with family, friends, and your partner in life, Sagittarius.
      You're unlikely to concentrate on work, and you might reach for the phone constantly to seek a friendly voice.
      Images of beautiful objects may dance in your head. Don't worry about your concentration. It will be back tomorrow! </p>
    </div>

    <div class = 'column'>

    <h2 id='love'> Love Reading (via horoscope.com) </h2>
    <p id='lovetxt'>The celestial lineup makes for quite a revealing day.
      There are many opportunities to get out and about and to have a wonderful time.
      Romance may catch you off guard, as you could meet someone who shares the same sense of humor:
      witty and slightly off center. You have much to discuss, especially your taste in humor. This could be a long-term laugh.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = 'column'>
    <h2 id='career'> Career Reading (via horoscope.com)</h2>
      <p id='careertxt'>You may be so busy second-guessing yourself that it becomes impossible for you to make
        any sort of decision whatsoever. Have faith in whatever decision you make.
        You are better off moving forward in some manner than not moving forward at all.</p>

            <h2>The Pope Card</h2>
            <p id='tarottxt'>
              The Hierophant is the masculine counterpart to The High Priestess. He is also known as the Pope.
                Work with a teacher, mentor, or guide to teach you about spiritual values and beliefs in a structured way.
                You may also undertake a period of formal study as you delve into a subject that has been widely explored and documented. If you have already mastered a particular field of study, you may be taking on the role of teacher and mentor to others. In this position, you honour and acknowledge
                your responsibility to share your knowledge in a structured way, one that respects the age-old traditions.
