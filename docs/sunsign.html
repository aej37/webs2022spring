    <h1>Sun Signs (via starslikeyou.com)</h1>

  <p>Your Sun sign refers to the relative position of the Sun in space (from our perspective on Earth) on the day that you were born.
   Your Sun or Star sign shows in which sign of the Zodiac the Sun was found when you were born. Rather than describing who you are, your Sun Sign points to what you are learning to develop and become. Think of it as the center of your personality, revealing your key motivations and drives.
   As you express the qualities of your Sun Sign, you experience greater fulfilment and self-confidence.</p>

   <p> The sun is your identity. It is the essence that you shine out into the world. It represents the vital force that drives you to seek the highest expression of your true self. Your sun sign is how you answer the question “I am” and how you experience life and express your individuality.</p>

<p>Your Sun sign has the greatest influence on how you see yourself, what motivates you and what you need to find happiness or fulfillment. <p>
