       You could be overly concerned with your appearance, possibly because you wish to impress a current or potential romantic partner.
       Don't worry; they'll think you look great. You could receive a lot of attention throughout the evening both from this person and others,
      which will cement the bonds you feel with all your friends. Enjoy! </p>

    <p id='lovetxt'>The current planetary configuration makes you and your partner (current or prospective) full of bright ideas about any and every aspect of life.
      This is a great time to plan an unusual excursion for the day. It is also a good time for nostalgia and for meeting up with friends from the past.
      You will both be in an optimistic frame of mind, and will seek out fun and entertainment.</p>
