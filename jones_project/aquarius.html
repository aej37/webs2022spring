    <h1 id='welcome'>Welcome Aquarius!</h1>
    <h2 id='daily'> Daily Reading (via horoscope.com)</h2>
    <p id='dailytxt'>You're a gregarious person by nature, Aquarius, and today you might want to socialize and enjoy yourself.
       You could be overly concerned with your appearance, possibly because you wish to impress a current or potential romantic partner.
       Don't worry; they'll think you look great. You could receive a lot of attention throughout the evening both from this person and others,
      which will cement the bonds you feel with all your friends. Enjoy! </p>


    <h2 id='love'> Love Reading (via horoscope.com) </h2>
    <p id='lovetxt'>The current planetary configuration makes you and your partner (current or prospective) full of bright ideas about any and every aspect of life.
      This is a great time to plan an unusual excursion for the day. It is also a good time for nostalgia and for meeting up with friends from the past.
      You will both be in an optimistic frame of mind, and will seek out fun and entertainment.</p>

    <h2 id='career'> Career Reading (via horoscope.com)</h2>
      <p id='careertxt'>The truth is very blurred, and facts are only going to get more confusing as the day wears on.
        The more people you talk to, the more bewildered you will become.
        Try not to make any major decisions at this time. Wait until the path is clearer.</p>
