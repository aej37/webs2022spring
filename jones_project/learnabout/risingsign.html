    <h1>Rising Signs (via starslikeyou.com)</h1>
    <p>Your Rising Sign describes how you project yourself out into the world, how other people see you, how you enter into new experiences, and the kinds of experiences you need in order for your life to feel meaningful.
    Just as important as your Sun and Moon signs, together these make up the main component of your astrological
     personality. You have probably worked out already that not everyone born with the same Zodiac, Sun or Star sign has the same approach to life.
    Your Rising Sign describes how you approach new experiences as you interact with your environment.
  </p>

      <p>Aries rising sign: You are likely to approach life in a straight-forward and direct manner. Aries is a physical and dynamic energy.
      Accordingly, you are likely to love a challenge, enjoy being busy and will generally move toward your goals without delay.</p>

      <p>Taurus rising sign: You are likely to prefer the slow and steady approach to life. Taurus is a practical and conservative sign.
        Wherever possible, you will feel better if moving forward in a methodical, systematic way.</p>

      <p>Gemini rising sign: You are likely to be an inquisitive individual,
        mostly open to new things. Unless other factors in your birth chart make you more introspective, you have a sense of curiosity that can open many doors and a desire to understand how people or things work which can make you well-liked.</p>

      <p>Cancer rising sign: Self-realization comes through a sophisticated attunement to your highly developed feeling nature. You make sense of life through instinct and emotion.
        You are likely to experience strong intuitions, and at times psychic sensibilities, and will therefore need to learn the difference between insight and projection.
      You will need to acknowledge your sensitivity, accept your desire to nurture and support others,
      and acknowledge when this sensitivity leads you to take on too much, or become overly responsible for how others feel.  </p>

      <p>Leo rising sign: you are likely to find that life presents you with the opportunity to become a leader or express your creativity somehow.
        Accordingly, you will have your own unique or special ways of doing this.
        Your innate talents need to be developed so that they can grow. In many ways, when Leo rises your task in life is to shine!</p>

        <p>Virgo rising sign: you are likely to view the world through the lens of mental analysis, with a view toward organization.
          You have strong critical faculties and need to find practical outlets for your skills, talents and abilities.</p>

        <p>Libra rising sign: Life feels like a constant series of choices. You aim to appear as fair, objective and
           balanced in all your interactions with others. Because your ruling planet is Venus you may also be
           gifted with a natural grace or beauty that gives you a pleasing appearance.</p>

        <p>Scorpio rising sign: you are likely to experience life as a constant series of obstacles or crises in which you learn about the nature of power through transformation.
          Whilst this may seem challenging, once understood in terms of a life lesson,
          you have the potential to be an inspirational and catalytic individual. </p>
