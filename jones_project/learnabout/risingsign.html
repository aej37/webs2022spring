    <h1>Rising Signs (via starslikeyou.com)</h1>
    <p>Your Rising Sign describes how you project yourself out into the world, how other people see you, how you enter into new experiences, and the kinds of experiences you need in order for your life to feel meaningful.
    Just as important as your Sun and Moon signs, together these make up the main component of your astrological
     personality. You have probably worked out already that not everyone born with the same Zodiac, Sun or Star sign has the same approach to life.
    Your Rising Sign describes how you approach new experiences as you interact with your environment.
  </p>

      <p>Aries rising sign: You are likely to approach life in a straight-forward and direct manner. Aries is a physical and dynamic energy.
      Accordingly, you are likely to love a challenge, enjoy being busy and will generally move toward your goals without delay.</p>

      <p>Taurus rising sign: You are likely to prefer the slow and steady approach to life. Taurus is a practical and conservative sign.
        Wherever possible, you will feel better if moving forward in a methodical, systematic way.</p>

      <p>Gemini rising sign: You are likely to be an inquisitive individual, 
        mostly open to new things. Unless other factors in your birth chart make you more introspective, you have a sense of curiosity that can open many doors and a desire to understand how people or things work which can make you well-liked.</p>
