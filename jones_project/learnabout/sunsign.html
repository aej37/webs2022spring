    <h1>Sun Signs (via starslikeyou.com)</h1>

  <p>Your Sun sign refers to the relative position of the Sun in space (from our perspective on Earth) on the day that you were born.
   Your Sun or Star sign shows in which sign of the Zodiac the Sun was found when you were born. Rather than describing who you are, your Sun Sign points to what you are learning to develop and become. Think of it as the center of your personality, revealing your key motivations and drives.
   As you express the qualities of your Sun Sign, you experience greater fulfilment and self-confidence.</p>

   <p>Aries Sun Sign: As the first sign of the Zodiac, Aries is all about ‘The New’. Those born with the Sun in Aries have a particular affinity with the energy needed to get things off the ground. Ariens tend to specialize
      in finding the energy required to start something, but are not renowned for their ability to finish things off.
      Aries tends to face each day with a sense of adventure and hopeful optimism. They must learn to
      balance their enthusiasm with proper consideration – to find the right avenues for their abundant energy.</p>

    <p>Taurus Sun Sign: Taureans are learning about security, and what it means to be able to maintain a stable sense of self. That which is tangible, or ‘real’ generates feelings of self-worth for Taurus that are hard to ignore. Taureans will often associate what is in front of them with how they feel about themselves.
      This is an Earth sign, giving stability, practicality and solidity to the personality structure.
      Taureans are known for dependability, loyalty and a realistic approach to life.</p>

    <p>Gemini Sun Sign: This is a sign of adaptability, flexibility, and change. That may vary from changing associates, to changing outfits and changing their minds. At its core, the freedom to be flexible is an essential part of the Gemini journey. Those with the Sun in Gemini can easily switch between their thinking or feeling modes. They react immediately to any
       stimulation within their environment, swapping opinions and points of focus, depending on prevailing circumstances. Geminis are often noted for a high degree of sociability, and those born with the Sun in Gemini can be quite refined, charming or gracious,
       knowing exactly how to quip and sparkle at just the right time to keep others entertained.</p>

    <p>Cancer Sun Sign: Born with the Sun in Cancer, you are likely to be motivated by the urge to establish emotional connectedness with others, and then take action to nourish, support and protect them.
      Cancer is a Water sign, and so, concerned with emotions, intuition, imagination and the psyche.It is also a Cardinal sign, implying the need to act.
      Within the realm of emotion, Cancerians are likely to be actively engaged. The emotional ties that bind to those closest are of primary concern.
      For this reason, Cancer is strongly associated with family and domestic life.</p>
