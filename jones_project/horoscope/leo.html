    <h1 id='welcome'>Hello Leo!</h1>
    <h2 id='daily'> Daily Reading (via horoscope.com)</h2>
    <p id='dailytxt'>Good news! It looks as if money is coming your way.
      Perhaps you're getting a good bonus, or perhaps you've received a good review and will be getting a substantial raise.
      Hearing about this will definitely boost your mood, Leo, and because you're feeling good,
      you'll be especially nice to those around you. They'll reciprocate in kind. Enjoy your day! </p>


    <h2 id='love'> Love Reading (via horoscope.com) </h2>
    <p id='lovetxt'>The day's celestial lineup may make this such an energetic day that you certainly won't wish to sit around quietly. There is such a sense of fun and laughter in the air! You may wish to hold a party or invite others around to share some time with you.
       It is also a wonderful chance to meet up with ex-love interests who still have a little flame burning for you.</p>

    <h2 id='career'> Career Reading (via horoscope.com)</h2>
      <p id='careertxt'>Don't be afraid to initiate something. Get started on a project or idea that you think is important and other people will follow automatically.
        You will have a great deal of support with just about anything, so get going on something you believe in.</p>

    <h2 id='tarot'>Tarot Reading of the Day (via biddytarot.com)</h2>
    <img src='images/leo_tarot.jpg' alt= 'Fool Card'>
    <p id='tarottxt'>The Fool is a card of new beginnings, opportunity and potential. Just like the young man, you are at the outset of your journey, standing at the cliff‘s edge, and about to take your first step into the unknown.
      Even though you don’t know exactly where you are going, you are being called to commit yourself and follow your heart,
      no matter how crazy this leap of faith might seem to you. The time is NOW! Take that leap of faith, even if you do not feel 100% ready or equipped for what is coming.
