    <h1 id='welcome'>Hello Libra!</h1>
    <h2 id='daily'> Daily Reading (via horoscope.com)</h2>
    <p id='dailytxt'>Today you might be feeling a very powerful and all-consuming love for everyone around you,
      and perhaps for all life forms in general. You're also likely to be feeling romantic, passionate, and anxious
      for the company of a love partner. Your imagination is flying high, Libra, and you could be trying to find a gift for a loved one.
      You're also feeling very spiritually inclined. </p>


    <h2 id='love'> Love Reading (via horoscope.com) </h2>
    <p id='lovetxt'>You will probably spend most of the day smiling.
      Whether or not you are already in a permanent relationship, the celestial lineup makes for a time
      when everything seems sunny, no matter what the weather. You may meet someone very interesting,
      but the key factor will be their sense of humor, and also their ability to talk about philosophical matters with a smile on their face.</p>

    <h2 id='career'> Career Reading (via horoscope.com)</h2>
      <p id='careertxt'>The day starts out on a rather sour note for you and unfortunately, it is only going to get worse.
         It is important that you nip small problems in the bud. Otherwise they will fester and get much more
         difficult to deal with in the afternoon.</p>
