    <h1>Hello Scorpio!</h1>
    <h2 id='daily'> Daily Reading (via horoscope.com)</h2>
    <p id='dailytxt'>You could feel a lot of fond affection for everyone around you today,
      even those you normally might find irritating. Co-workers, friends, family, and the special
      person in your life are likely to be happier for having basked in this glow, and should reciprocate.
      You're feeling especially generous,
      Scorpio, so buying gifts is likely to be on your agenda. Don't forget to be kind to yourself, too. </p>


    <h2 id='love'> Love Reading (via horoscope.com) </h2>
    <p id='lovetxt'>You will have no choice but to cease being hardworking and responsible, and be very relaxed -
      even laid-back. The celestial lineup will probably have you horizontal with laughter before the day is over,
      and this may not be because you find your own company particularly funny. A significant other may discover the
       subject that makes you giggle helplessly, and won't stop joking about it.
     </p>

    <h2 id='career'> Career Reading (via horoscope.com)</h2>
      <p id='careertxt'>You are likely to resist someone else's ideas or wishes because you sense that this person is
        trying to control or manipulate you. Most likely, this person is simply trying to help you,
        so be open and willing to accept advice from others.</p>

    <h2 id='tarot'>Tarot Reading of the Day (via biddytarot.com)</h2>
    <img src='images/scorpio_tarot.jpg' alt= 'Death Card'>
    <p id='tarottxt'>The Death card is probably the most feared and misunderstood of all the cards in the Tarot deck.
      Relax! The Death card can be one of the most positive cards in the deck.Death shows a time of significant transformation, change, and transition.
      You need to transform yourself and clear away the old to bring in the new.
      Any change should be welcomed as a positive, cleansing, transformational force in your life.
      The death and clearing away of limiting factors can open the door to a broader, more satisfying
      experience of life.
