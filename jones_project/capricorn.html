    <h1 id='welcome'>Hello Capricorn!</h1>
    <h2 id='daily'> Daily Reading (via horoscope.com)</h2>
    <p id='dailytxt'>Your natural sensitivity and compassion are given a powerful impetus today by strong feelings
       of love and affection for everyone around you, Capricorn.
      Therefore, you're likely to give and receive a lot of expressions of affection, both overt and subtle.
      A significant other should feel especially romantic toward you,so relax and let him or her shower you with
      attention. </p>


    <h2 id='love'> Love Reading (via horoscope.com) </h2>
    <p id='lovetxt'>The day's celestial lineup suggests that you have every chance to make friends and
      loved ones feel good. If you are planning a dinner party or an outing, it will be great fun.
      And if you are looking for romance, your first introduction may well be a joke that both
      of you find extremely funny. This could be one wacky day you will not forget.</p>

    <h2 id='career'> Career Reading (via horoscope.com)</h2>
      <p id='careertxt'>Deep down, a lack of self-confidence is keeping you from reaching your highest potential.
        Perhaps a long time ago, someone made you feel like you were not fit to accomplish anything noteworthy.
        Banish these thoughts from your mind. They are untrue.</p>

            <h2>The Justice Card</h2>
            <p id='tarottxt'>
              The Justice card represents justice, fairness, truth and the law. You are being called to account for your actions and will be judged accordingly. If you have acted in alignment with your Higher Self and for the greater good of others, you have nothing to worry about.
                However, if you havenâ€™t, you will be called out and made to own up to your actions. A level of compassion and understanding accompany Justice, and although you may have done something you regret, this card suggests that you will be treated fairly and without bias.
                Be ready to take responsibility for your actions and stand accountable for the ensuing consequences.
