    <h1 id='welcome'>Hello Gemini!</h1>
    <h2 id='daily'> Daily Reading (via horoscope.com)</h2>
    <p id='dailytxt'>You should feel exhilarated today, Gemini.
      You might choose to channel some of this enthusiasm into decorating your home.
      Your aesthetic sense is sharp, as is your physical energy, so once you set upon a particular course of action,
      you aren't likely to abandon it. Family members or others close to you may join you and create an atmosphere of
      strong companionship. Make an impromptu party of it. Get going, and enjoy yourself! </p>


    <h2 id='love'> Love Reading (via horoscope.com) </h2>
    <p id='lovetxt'>You may not care what the odds are, how big a gamble it is, or even about the thought of losing.
      Today you are only interested in the chase.
      You are willing to do whatever it takes to get the person of your dreams as interested in you as you are in them
      - even if this involves doing or saying anything outrageous.</p>

    <h2 id='career'> Career Reading (via horoscope.com)</h2>
      <p id='careertxt'>If something is working smoothly, let it be. There is no sense trying to disrupt the flow when
        everything seems to be working together just fine.
        Offer your two cents when it is asked of you. Otherwise, keep your opinions to yourself.</p>

    <h2 id='tarot'>Tarot Reading of the Day (via biddytarot.com)</h2>
    <img src='images/gemini_tarot.jpg' alt='Strength Card'>
    <p id='tarottxt'>The Strength card represents strength, determination, and power - When the Strength Tarot card appears in a reading, you are fueled by your inner strength, personal power, strong will and determination.
       You do not rule by trying to control others; you quietly influence and persuade. Your strength gives you the confidence to overcome any growing fears, challenges or doubts.
       Feel the fear and do it anyway! If you have been going through a rough time and are burnt out or stressed,
       the Strength card encourages you to find the power within yourself to persevere.
