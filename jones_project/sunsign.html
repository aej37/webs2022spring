    <h1>Sun Signs (via starslikeyou.com)</h1>

  <p>Your Sun sign refers to the relative position of the Sun in space (from our perspective on Earth) on the day that you were born.
   Your Sun or Star sign shows in which sign of the Zodiac the Sun was found when you were born. Rather than describing who you are, your Sun Sign points to what you are learning to develop and become. Think of it as the center of your personality, revealing your key motivations and drives.
