            <h2>The Fool Card</h2>
            <p id='tarottxt'>
              The Fool is a card of new beginnings, opportunity and potential. Just like the young man, you are at the outset of your journey, standing at the cliff‘s edge, and about to take your first step into the unknown.
                Even though you don’t know exactly where you are going, you are being called to commit yourself and follow your heart,
                no matter how crazy this leap of faith might seem to you. The time is NOW! Take that leap of faith, even if you do not feel 100% ready or equipped for what is coming.
